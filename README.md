# phishing-lab
For a school project where we need to make a phishing website to STEAL people's SENSITIVE INFORMATION

## Build instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run endpoint .py by navigating to the repository directory and typing py .\endpoint.py
 1. Make sure you have the flask and flask-cors Python packages installed
 2. To install, run py -m pip install flask and py -m pip install flask-cors
3. Run the webpage locally using npm, python, or the VScode live server extension

If you have python3 installed:

```
cd ~/phishing-lab
python3 -m http.server 5000
```

If you have npm installed (recommended)

1) Install serve (it is a global install, be warned!)
2) serve the dir

```
npm i -g serve
cd ~/phishing-lab
serve
```

6. Phish yourself by typing in your username and password and watch the credentials appear on the python program (DO NOT PHISH OTHER REAL PEOPLE!!!!!!!!)
7. Get redirected to the official website to make it appear as if nothing suspicious happened
